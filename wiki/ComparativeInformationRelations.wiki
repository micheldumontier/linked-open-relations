#summary compare individuals with regard to a quality

= Introduction =

 _preliminary_

Comparative relations relate two individuals with regard to quality values of these individuals. They can either represent the equality of individuals with regard to this quality or their difference and further specify this inequality.

= Components =

  * in relation to -> indicates the reference object / part / quality
  * has qualifier -> increased, decreased, etc.

= Details =

 * numerical comparison: _compn_(m, n)
   m, n are numbers on nomial, ordinal, interval, ratio scales. _compn_ is one of: _equals, unequals_ for all scale types of n, m with m=n for _equals_ and m!=n for _unequals_. unequals is on of _larger than/ smaller than_ for m, n on ordinal, inverall and ratio scales with m>n for _larger than_ and m<n for _smaller than_. _difference of_ is defined as quantification of inequality for intervall and ratio scales as |m-n| (and as _rank difference_ for ordinal scales), _ratio of_ is only defined for ratio scales as m/n.
 * numerical comparison: _compn_(m, n, i)
   _similarity_ is defined as _smaller than_(_difference_(n, m), i) with n, m on ordinal, intervall and ration scales and i an intervall width on ordinal, intervall and ratio scales.
 

 * generic comparison: _comp_(a, b, qa, qb, m, n, i)
   For entities a, b of generic type with qualities qa, qb having values (or regions) m of qa and n of qb, the following _comp_ relations can be defined:

 * generic comparison with triangulation: _comp_(a, b, qa, qb, m, n, c, qc, p, i)
   For entities, qualities and values (regions) as above the generic reference entity c with quality qc and its value p, the following _comp_ relations can be defined: 



=== (non exhaustive) list of comparisons ==

 * similarity/ equality vs. dissimilarity/ inequality
 * quality of distinction (color, tone)
 * direction of difference (ordering)
 * (absolute) size of difference (magnitude, scale)
 * algebraic properties of differences (ratio is meaningful, scale, inversity, symmetry, reflexivity?, transitivity?)
 * intended precision of similarity (explicit vagueness)
 * relational system specified (normative element(s) stated)
 * etc.


= Questions =

  * Possibly, some of the information relations are (ternary) comparative: has_rank  is comparative. One can have only have a rank in comparison to other individuals (so this is the assignment of a number depending on the comparison)???

= Examples =

  * 'is similar to'
  * 'is different from'
  * 'has high plasma membrane amount' / 'has low plasma membrane part'
  * 'has high plasma membrane part' / 'has low plasma membrane amount' 

= Ternary relation model =

An RDF-expressible ternary model is proposed:
Consider two comparanda C1 and C2, which are particulars that are compared. Consider a particular quality Q1.

E.g. C1 and C2 are stars. Q1 is brightness magnitude.
  * C1 is decreased in magnitude relative to C2

<=>

  * 'is decreased in magnitude relative to' rdfs:subPropertyOf 'is before'
  * C1 'is before' C2
  * C1 'participates in' _comparison654231
  * 'is before' 'participates in' _comparison654231
  * C2 'participates in' _comparison654231
  * _comparison654231 'is bearer of' magnitude_quality_Q1
