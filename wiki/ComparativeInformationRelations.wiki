#summary compare individuals with regard to a quality

= Introduction =

 _preliminary_

Comparative relations relate two individuals with regard to the same quality of these individuals without assigning a quantity for the level of difference/ congruence towards it. They can either represent the equality of individuals with regard to this quality or their difference. Difference can be further qualified as either increased or decreased (changed into a certain direction) if there is a normative system for the quality in question.

== Comparison ==
 * similarity/ equality vs. dissimilarity/ inequality
 * quality of distinction (color, tone)
 * direction of difference (ordering)
 * (absolute) size of difference (magnitude, scale)
 * algebraic properties of differences (ratio is meaningful, scale, inversity, symmetry, reflexivity?, transitivity?)
 * intended precision of similarity (explicit vagueness)
 * relational system specified (normative element(s) stated)
 * etc.

= Components =

  * in relation to -> indicates the reference object / part / quality
  * has qualifier -> increased, decreased, etc

= Questions =

  * Possibly, some of the information relations are (ternary) comparative: has_rank  is comparative. One can have only have a rank in comparison to other individuals (so this is the assignment of a number depending on the comparison)???

= Examples =

  * 'is similar to'
  * 'is different from'
  * 'has high plasma membrane amount' / 'has low plasma membrane part'
  * 'has high plasma membrane part' / 'has low plasma membrane amount' 

= Ternary relation model =

An RDF-expressible ternary model is proposed:
Consider two comparanda C1 and C2, which are particulars that are compared. Consider a particular quality Q1.

E.g. C1 and C2 are stars. Q1 is brightness magnitude.
  * C1 is decreased in magnitude relative to C2

<=>

  * 'is decreased in magnitude relative to' rdfs:subPropertyOf 'is before'
  * C1 'is before' C2
  * C1 'participates in' _comparison654231
  * 'is before' 'participates in' _comparison654231
  * C2 'participates in' _comparison654231
  * _comparison654231 'is bearer of' magnitude_quality_Q1
