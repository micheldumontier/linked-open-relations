=Mission statement:=
Create a domain independent standard for Semantic Web relations

=Scope=
The objective of lore is to harvest binary predicates and relations that are in use, improve them and organize them from a perspective of scientific Knowledge Management and Formal Ontology. 

LORE is proposing to provide 
# an orthogonal, domain-independent set of binary relations expressed as a (limited) list of OWL object-properties;
# a characterization of each relation in terms of meaning, scope restrictions, algebraic properties; 
# practices for creating and transforming predicate-like relations from the semantic Web that are not within this list.
# develop and for (1) chaining LORE relations and for (2) transforming triple-like expressions containing non-LORE relations into triples containing LORE relations. 
# assess these rules using real data. In contrast to the practice of formal ontology, rule are not either true or false. Rather, we assess the usefulness of rules from a retrieval background (precision / recall). For instance, if a rule tends to overgenerate, it may still be useful in a recall-optimized information retrieval scenario. 


=Terminological issues
There are controversies regarding the use of terms like "relation", "relationships", "role", "relation type", "relation instance", "relation assertion", "predicate", "predication". 
Until these controversies are settled we use uniformly the word "relation", distinguishing between LORE and non-LORE relations.

=Three semantic levels:=
LORE relations are, in a first approximation, distinguished between the following three semantic levels:

 * LEVEL 1) 
relations denote predicate-like (e.g. ‘stands in’, `phosphorylizes´), close to natural language
 * LEVEL 2) generic, ontological relations that are accessible for widespread usage (e.g. ‘is located in’), and 
 * LEVEL 3) Relations that are refinements of Level 2 relations, which can normally be fully defined.  

Level 2 would be such that levels 1 and 3 can contain subrelation (or chained relations) of 2.  
Levels (1) and (2) would be SPARQL-friendly.
Levels (2) and (3) would be reasoning-friendly.


Level 1 relations are mostly intuitively understandable, but may be ambiguous and highly context-dependent. Level 2 and 3 relations may be enigmatic (e.g. ‘is physical proper part of’), and not easily understandable to people outside KM. A convenient naming of these relations is therefore important.


LORE provides standard practices for all three levels. It provides actual relations in levels (2) and (3). At least for (2), they are expressed as owl:objectProperty’s. In level (1), popular and important examples may be provided. In level (3), modeling practices (via OWL) may be provided. Level (2) will be specially promoted by LORE, in order to enable easier upgrade to level (3).
