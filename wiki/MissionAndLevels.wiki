==Mission statement:==
Create a domain independent standard for Semantic Web relations

==Scope==
The objective of LORE is to create a practical set of relations for use on the Semantic Web. 

LORE will provide 
 * an orthogonal, domain-independent set of binary relations expressed as a (limited) list of OWL object-properties;

 * a characterization of each relation in terms of meaning, scope, algebraic properties; 

 * practices for defining complex relations from the Semantic Web that are not in LORE's core list.

 * continuously evaluate LORE relations and their application 

==Terminological issues==
There is ambiguous use of terms like "relation", "relationships", "role", "relation type", "relation instance", "relation assertion", "predicate", "predication". In LORE, we will use the term "relation".

==Three semantic levels==
LORE classifies relations as, in a first approximation, distinguished between the following three semantic levels:

===LEVEL 1===
Level 1 relations are those drawn from natural language (e.g. *stands in*, *phosphorylizes*, *has-author*)

Characteristics of level 1 relations:

 * Intuitively understandable

 * Most of these relations would better describe the domain if they were n-ary (n > 2)

 * possibly ambiguous and context-dependent

 * There is also a tendency to assert level 1 relations between classes _Insulin_ *stimulates* _Receptor_

 * may be expressed as classes, e.g. _Phosphorylation_, _Authoring_..., in order to express dispositional or procedural knowledge. 

 * SPARQL - friendly

===LEVEL 2=== 
These relations are ontological in a strict sense. They have the following characteristics: 

 * They can be applied across domains (domain-independent)

 * They are generally binary, although time may be a third argument

 * They can be used for expressing core entity attributes as necessary conditions by universal quantification.

 * Despite their universal applicability they are seldomly used in triple stores

 * Reasoner - friendly, but also SPARQL
 

===LEVEL 3=== 
These relations are refinements of Level 2 relations. 
Characteristics:

 * They can be fully defined.

 * are often domain dependent. Example: *has-town* is a level 3 subrelation of *has-part* with a range restricted to "town". 

 * Reasoner friendy


==How LORE addresses the three levels==

LORE provides standard practices and relations for all three levels. Only for level 2 it claims to be exhaustive. Level 2 relations will be expressed as OWL object properties. Level 1 and 3 relations are added as long they are largely domain-independent and considered important by the Semantic Web community. 

LORE will not just replicate popular relations that already have already introduced elsewhere (Dublin Core, FOAF, ...). However, LORE will propose solutions how to transform sets of triples containing level 1 or 3 relations into sets of triples containing level two relations.

For all levels popular and important examples may be provided.  

== LORE rules ==

Rules are an important means for transforming between relation expressions. The following example instantiates a rule that transforms between level 2 and level 3:

{{{
 France *has-province* Bretagne
 <=>
 France *has-part* Bretagne
 Bretagne *rdf:type* Province 

}}}

The rule could be abstracted as 
   
{{{
 (?X *has-province* ?Y) 
 <=>
 (?X *has-part* ?Y)
 (?Y *rdf:type* Province)
}}}

The next rule example applies to the transformation between level 1 and 2

{{{
 Mozart *is-composer-of* Magic Flute
 <=>
 Composing#238742 *rdf:type* Composing
 Composing#238742 *has-agent* Mozart
 Composing#238742 *has-target* Magic Flute
}}}

using a rule like
{{{
 ?a *is-composer-of* ?b
 <=>
 _c *rdf:type* Composing
 _c *has-agent* ?a
 _c *has-target* ?b 
}}}
