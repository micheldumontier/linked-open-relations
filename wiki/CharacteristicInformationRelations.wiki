#summary Informational relations

= Introduction =

An information relation is a relation that pertains to information, models and representations, summarized as information entities. 
Information entities are immaterial, but they can exist in material entities such as brains, computer disks, sheets of paper.

*has information part* 

inverse: "is information part of"

This relation is used to describe the mereological setup of information entities. For instance, an abstract is an information part of a scientific paper, an operator is an information part of a mathematical formula, a letter is part of a word, etc. 

Axioms: 

* information entities can only have information entities as parts and are always parts of information entities. 

* "is information part of" and its inverse are reflexive and transitive

* "is information part of" is fully defined as "part of", that has information entities in their domain and range. 





*denotes*

The relation „denotes“ relates an information entity with some other entity.  Example: the string of character “Barack Obama”, denotes the person Barack Obama. The string “The president of the U.S.” denotes him in 2012, but not in 2007. An X-ray image denotes a chest of a certain patient at a certain time. 

*Inverse*: “denoted by”

*Alternative names*: “is about”

*Issues*. 
The representation of denotation as a binary relation is a simplification. Denotation is time-dependent (see the president example), and it is also dependent on the users. It depends on human conventions such as the meaning of a vocabulary (E.g., in Italian “Monaco” denotes both the country Monaco and the city of Munich). Denotation is frequently not only asserted between individuals but between an individual (the symbol) and a class type. E.g. the word “computer” denotes the class of all computers. Again, this depends on time and conventions, e.g. in German “computer” has always denotes a machine; in English it used to denote “computing professionals” in the past.
