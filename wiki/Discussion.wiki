#topics that need to be discussed

= Discussion items for the next teleconference =

== Wednesday 7 March 4 pm CET ==

- Stefan: Naming proposal: is a location of, has as part, is a part of, ...

- Michel and Ward: Terminology for 'relations'. What is an instance of a relation?

- Stefan and Martin: charactertic versus comparative informational relation types

- Andre: Which upper level commitments are we making? (e.g. process, material entity, dimensions,...)

- Andre and Ward: should we model temporal relations as the special 1-dimensional case of more generic mereological relations that apply to n dimensions? (e.g. 'overlaps with' in n dimensions?)

- Andre and Ward: can relation types be defined more generic than what would be assumed by reasoners (e.g. temporal relations that can make sense for scattered temporal entities, even though convex entities are expected standardly)

- Andre: had some problems with the action relations too: a child destroys a cup with a hammer, after his father had explained the child how to use the hammer. Does the father, by his indirect action, destroy the cup? Maybe something for the 'issue'-section of such relation types.
