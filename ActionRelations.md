# Action relations #

**Name:** interacts with

**Definition:** For entities S and O, it holds that ‘S interacts with O’, if and only if 1) S and O are in spatial proximity over some duration of time, and 2) they act in such a way that they have an effect on each other.

**Examples:** A boy interacts with his father, a small molecule interacts with an enzyme.

**Issues:**

**Algebraic properties:** symmetric

**Name:** creates

**Definition:** For entities S and O, it holds that 'S creates O', if and only if 1) an action of S directly or indirectly leads to the existence of O.

**Examples:** an artist paints a painting, a ribosome synthesizes a protein, a diver creates a wave

**Name:** modifies

**Definition:** For entities S and O, it holds that 'S modifies O', if and only if 1) S and O are in direct or indirect physical contact, and 2) one or more qualities or attribute values of O changes as a result of its interaction with S.

**Examples:** An enzymes phosphorylates its target, a desiccator dries a sample,

**Name:** destroys

**Definition:** For entities S and O, it holds that 'S destroys O', if and only if 1) an action of S directly or indirectly leads to the non-existence of O.

**Examples:** An enzyme cleaves its substrate, a secretary shreds a sensitive document,
