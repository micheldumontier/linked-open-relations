## Introduction ##
The project **LORE**, or Linked Open Relations, aims to facilitate the establishment of standards for Semantic Web relations. This is done by establishing modelling practices and by providing an actual standardized list of relations. For example:

Modelling practices: use a verb in the name of the relation type, use an HTTP-style URI, ...

Standardized relations: 'is part of', 'is located in', ...

## Mission statement ##
Create a domain independent standard for Semantic Web relations

## Scope ##
The objective of LORE is to create a practical set of relations for use on the Semantic Web.

LORE will provide
  * an orthogonal, domain-independent set of binary relations expressed as a (limited) list of OWL object-properties;

  * a characterization of each relation in terms of meaning, scope, algebraic properties;

  * practices for defining complex relations from the Semantic Web that are not in LORE's core list.

  * continuously evaluate LORE relations and their application
