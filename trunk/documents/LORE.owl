Axioms: specificly, relates the values of a certain quality of two particulars, hence, relates a specific quality of two particulars, hence, relates two particulars, hence, the domain and range are: (value region, quality, particular)/(value region, quality, particular) Algebraic properties: transitive, reflexive, symmetric. Issues: The meaning of the comparative results for all of these binary generic comparative relations for particulars can be exactly specified for most scale types (see details below) and is only an issue for certain categorial qualities (e.g. color). The main issue of all af these generic comparative relations is disambiguation of what exactly is related to each otherm where not specified. Hence, the problem is how to define the exact application and give rules for that: e.g. the quality which is compared when particulars are compared local vs. global (semantic web) use. In a defined local scenario the context may clearly disambigute the related.</oboInOwl:comment>
        <oboInOwl:def>&quot;The binary relation equals holds iff two compared particulars are &#39;equal&#39;. This equality can either be quantitative which is a numerical equality or qualitative which is the categorial equality of the two particulars.&quot; [LORE:mb]</oboInOwl:def>

        <rdfs:label rdf:datatype="&xsd;string">has associate</rdfs:label>
        <oboInOwl:def>&quot;The relation &#39;has associate&#39; is used as a superrelation for associative relations. These characterize independent entities through associates, which are other independent entities. The independence of associates are opposed to qualities, which are dependent entities and only exist for the sake of characterizing independent entities. Hence, lengths, colors and temperatures are qualities, related to via &#39;has quality&#39;, whereas objects and processes are entities that can be associates and that can have associates.&quot; [LORE:wb]</oboInOwl:def>
        <oboInOwl:comment>Example: USA has associate Barack Obama (USA has president Barack Obama), John has associate room A.123 (John has office room A.123), Pete has associate Max (Pete has pet Max), Company123 has associate Ken (Company123 has employee Ken). Inverse: &#39;has associate&#39; (symmetric) Algebraic properties: symmetric, not transitive, not antitransitive. Issues: This relation is very generic and serves to create enough recall for querying on the multitude of associative relations. The relation is rather epistemological (dependent on human choices in describing knowledge) than ontological (objectively verifiable), since it holds after the creation of any associative relation between two entities. Even with restrictions on the set of associative relations, through guidelines or an extended logical definition that uses unions and disjointness of relations, it will remain hard to determine objectively whether two objects are associated to each other or not. We could however argue that any particular associative relation should be ontological, and that there exists a logical definition of &#39;has associate&#39;, as a union of such ontological associative relations, that is such that the majority of pairs of entities are not associated. This would render &#39;has associate&#39; as an ontological relation with practical use. In the absence of this definition, it remains epistemological.</oboInOwl:comment>

        <oboInOwl:comment>Examples: Pete is located in his car, Iceland is located in Europe. Problems: the application of &#39;is located in&#39; depends on the definition of the outside borders of O.

        <oboInOwl:comment>Examples: Crete is part of Europe, this morning is part of today, my skin is part of my body, this third chapter is part of this book. Problems: #&#39;is part of&#39; has a broader application compared to other mereological relation types like &#39;is located in&#39;, since it is also used for time. It is still left open whether we will distinguish this temporal meaning of &#39;is part of&#39; by a different name. #&#39;is part of&#39; in ordinary speech is often understood to exclude reflexivity.
